# JSX
__JSX__ is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language but has a full power of [JavaScript](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). JSX is compiled to __React.createElement()__ calls, which return plain JavaScript objects call _React elements_. For example:
```javascript
return (
  <div>
    <h1>MyCar</h1>
  </div>
);
```
The code between the return method that looks like HTML is JSX.
